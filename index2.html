	<p>You will be shown <strong>Botticelli’s Three Graces</strong> from his Primavera, 1482, fig. 76, and Raphael’s Three Graces, 1505-6, fig. 81.  You should compare and contrast the two works in terms of their compositions, treatment of the female figure (line, contour, proportion, modeling, <em>three-dimensionality</em>, evocation of flesh, etc.), and their relation to antique sources.  Your essay should reflect your reading of Chapter 3, “Venus I” (pp. 71-117 and in particular pp. 97-106) in Kenneth Clark’s The Nude.  Finally, you should explain why Clark includes both Botticelli’s and Raphael’s Three Graces in the “Venus I” or <strong>“Celestial Venus”</strong> category as opposed to the “Venus II” or “Venus Naturalis” category.</p>
